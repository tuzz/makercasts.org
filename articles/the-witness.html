        <h2>Spoiler Alert</h2>

        <p>
        This article contains major spoilers for The Witness. It goes into
        moderate detail about puzzle pieces.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Background</h2>

        <p>
        Recently, I've been looking at Complexity Theory, which is a field in
        theoretical Computer Science. It concerns itself with how long
        algorithms take to run and how much space they use. It tries to classify
        problems as 'easy' or 'difficult' depending on the algorithms we have
        for solving them. In fact, it's far more textured than that. Problems
        form a hierarchy that relates the difficulties of seemingly disparate
        problems with one another.
        </p>

        <p>
        You may have heard of the Travelling Salesperson Problem. That's
        classified as 'NP-hard'. How about checking if a number is prime? That's
        'Polynomial'. What do these mean? Well, I'm not going to go into it
        here, but the point is that we can say with utmost confidence that
        solving the Travelling Salesperson Problem is inherently, a much more
        difficult problem than testing primality. We've connected seemingly
        unrelated things by weaving a fabric of complexity analysis between
        them. I find that fascinating.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>The Witness</h2>

        <p>
        So what's this article about? I'd like to try to weave that fabric a
        little further and take a look at Jonathan Blow's puzzles from The
        Witness. We'll go through something called a 'reduction', which is a
        method for transforming one problem into another. You can think of this
        as an algorithm that takes, as input, some representation of one problem
        and produces, as output, some other kind of problem.
        </p>

        <p>
        Reductions are the threads that form this fabric. If we can find a
        reduction from problem A to B we can make claims about their relative
        difficulty. We can say that A cannot possibly be harder than B, because
        we can always just transform A into B and solve that instead. This does
        assume our reduction isn't too difficult to compute, otherwise we'd have
        to factor that in, too.
        </p>

        <p>
        To be more specific, I'm going to demonstrate a reduction from a problem
        called 'Boolean Satisfiability', to puzzles from The Witness. This will
        give us an opportunity to see how reductions work in the context of
        something fun. When I first encountered reductions, I felt confused and
        didn't understand how people came up with them. This article is the
        walk-through I wish I'd had to build that intuition.
        </p>

        <div class="row-of-images">

            <figcaption>Boolean Satisfiability is often abbreviated to 'SAT'</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

        <p>
        At this point, I should explain that if you are well-versed in
        Complexity Theory, this reduction would be a somewhat frivolous
        endeavour. The SAT problem (as it is often abbreviated) is a 'hard'
        problem and so by reducing SAT to The Witness, we're showing that
        puzzles from The Witness are at least as difficult as an already
        difficult problem. Not an earth-shattering result. The real charm would
        be to go in the other direction, but we're not going to do that today.
        Instead, we'll embrace the futility and frivolity.

        <h2>Getting Started</h2>

        <p>
        We should start by refreshing our memory on SAT.
        </p>

        <p>
        SAT is the problem of finding a satisfying assignment for a boolean
        equation. In short, we need to come up with a true or false value for
        each variable in the equation to make the whole thing true. Here's an
        example problem:
        </p>

        <p class="sat single-word">(A v !B) ^ (!B v !C)</p>

        <p>
        This can be read as <span class="single-word">'(A or not B)</span> and
        <span class="single-word">(not B or not C)'</span>. Let's try to
        solve this problem. What if we assigned A=true, B=true, C=true ? Well,
        that satisfies the first clause because
        <span class="single-word">(true or false)</span> is true. How
        about the second? That's
        <span class="single-word">(false or false)</span> which evaluates to
        false. Our attempt has failed.
        </p>

        <p>
        Ok, so how do we fix it? How about A=true, B=true, C=false ? That works
        because each and every clause now evaluates to true and the equation has
        been satisfied. That wasn't so hard! Just a few moments ago I said this
        was a 'hard' problem. Well, this one was easy, but in general that's not
        the case. As we add more variables, the difficulty scales exponentially.
        </p>

        <p>
        You may be wondering why we care about this problem in the first place.
        Why did we pick this? Well, clever people have already figured out how
        to reduce a plethora of other problems to SAT. Really important ones,
        too, like route planning and laying out circuit boards efficiently. In
        fact, SAT is depended on so heavily, there's an annual competition to
        see who can write the best solver. I expect to see your entry next year!
        </p>

        <p>
        Ok, that's SAT out of the way. What about The Witness? Well, I'm not
        going to explain what all of the symbols mean here. If you're hazy on
        the details you can click on these to refresh your memory:

        <p>
        There are more puzzle pieces in the game, but this is just enough to do
        our reduction, so let's get on with that.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>The Reduction</h2>

        <p>
        So how do we do this? We need to come up with a method for transforming
        any SAT problem into a Witness puzzle. There should be a solution to the
        puzzle only if the SAT problem can be satisfied and there should be no
        solutions when it cannot. We somehow need to encode the structure of
        a generic boolean equation inside a Witness puzzle. So let's think about
        how we might do that.
        </p>

        <p>
        The first thing to note is that each clause in a SAT problem is
        connected with an AND. Every one of these must evaluate to true for it
        to be a correct solution. This is vaguely reminiscent of the Sun symbols
        in The Witness. Each Sun must be paired up with another Sun of the same
        colour for there to be a solution. This is a bit tenuous, but maybe we
        can do something with this similarity.
        </p>

        <p>
        Ok, what else do we know?
        </p>

        <p>
        The way to solve a SAT problem is by choosing between true and false for
        each of the variables in the equation. There's a notion of 'choice'.
        What does it mean to 'choose' something in a Witness puzzle? What's the
        corresponding action for choosing? Well, the only influence a puzzler
        has over a Witness puzzle is to choose their path from start to finish.
        Do I go North, East, South or West at this junction?
        </p>

        <p>
        So perhaps we could model variables as forks in the road that the
        puzzler must choose between. Taking the left fork could correspond to
        A=true and the right fork could be A=false. Now let's try to put this
        together with our Suns idea. Let's invent a red Sun to represent the
        first clause. In our SAT problem, if assigning A=true satisfies the
        clause, we should design our puzzle so that the Sun is paired up. If
        they choose to go right, the clause has not been satisfied so this
        should be an incorrect solution to the puzzle:
        </p>

        <div class="row-of-images">
          <figure class="medium-size">
            <img alt="Left Fork (A=true)" src="images/left-fork.png" />
            <figcaption>Left Fork: A=true</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <figure class="medium-size">
            <img alt="Right Fork (A=false)" src="images/right-fork.png" />
            <figcaption>Right Fork: A=false</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

        <p>
        So that's the basic idea. To recap, we're going take our SAT problem
        (whatever that may be) and turn it into a Witness puzzle. We're going to
        add a Sun for each clause and force the puzzler to make a choice
        as to whether to take a left fork or a right fork corresponding to a
        true or false assignment for each of the variables. We'll construct our
        puzzle based on which variables appear in which clauses and whether they
        are negated or not.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Starting Small</h2>

        <p>
        Let's start by trying to create a puzzle for
        <span class="single-word">(A v B).</span> This seems like the smallest
        possible step on the way to formulating a general method. We still have
        a single clause but we've added a variable. If we follow the rule of
        inventing a Sun for each clause in our equation, our puzzle should still
        only have a single colour Sun.  What's different is the number of
        variables within that clause. There is now more than one way to satisfy
        this equation.
        </p>

        <p>
        This means we need to build a puzzle that can be solved if either A=true
        or B=true. How do we do this? If we follow our rule that each variable
        is a fork in the road, we immediately hit an abundance of problems.
        Firstly, where do we put those forks? Do we stack forks on top of each
        other? Something like this:
        </p>

        <div class="row-of-images">
          <figure class="xlarge-size">
            <img alt="Stacked Forks" src="images/stacked-forks.png" />
            <figcaption>Stacking forks on top of each other</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

        <p>
        If we go with that, how do we arrange our Suns? Let's make an arbitrary
        decision and place the Sun for the clause in the bottom-right corner.
        We then need to pair up this Sun if either A=true or B=true. This
        clearly isn't going to work. If we choose A=false, we've isolated our
        Sun so no matter how we choose B, we can't solve the puzzle. What's
        more, we're going to end up with three Suns in the puzzle and won't be
        able to pair them.
        </p>

        <p>
        So how do we proceed? Let's think about our SAT problem again. We know
        that <span class="single-word">(A v B)</span> is satisfied if either A
        or B is true. This is an 'at least one' relationship, i.e. at least one
        of the variables must evaluate to true for the clause to be true. Suns
        work a bit differently. Suns must be paired with 'exactly one' other
        Sun. Three or four just won't do! So if we can change these semantics
        from 'exactly one' to 'at least one' we may have a chance.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>'at least one'</h2>

        <p>
        Let's restate our goal: We need to find a way to construct a Witness
        puzzle so that a Sun representing the clause can be paired with another
        Sun. We need to do so in a way that allows for any number of Suns of the
        same colour to appear in the puzzle. Blimey!
        </p>

        <p>
        Perhaps Elimination Marks can help with this. Let's construct a puzzle
        with a Sun representing the clause placed in the bottom-right position.
        We'll then place 'at least one' other Sun in the puzzle and think about
        how we can use Elimination Marks to eliminate the excess Suns. The
        following puzzle isn't quite right, but it demonstrates what we're
        trying to do:
        </p>

        <div class="row-of-images">
          <figure class="xxlarge-size">
            <img alt="Trying to pair up the bottom-right Sun" src="images/elimination-faulty.png" />
            <figcaption>Trying to pair up the bottom-right Sun</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

        <p>
        What's wrong with this approach? Well, we've successfully paired up the
        bottom-right Sun with one other Sun, but we've left an Elimination Mark
        dangling. There are no 'mistakes' in that 1x1 region for the Elimination
        Mark to mop up. Because of this, the path drawn above is not a correct
        solution.
        </p>

        <p>
        What can we learn from this? Firstly, we should note that we
        can stack as many Suns on the left as we'd like, which means we're on
        the right track to meet our 'at least one' requirement. Secondly, we can
        choose which of the Suns to pair up depending on how we draw the path.
        Finally, we can force where the puzzler must go by simply removing
        sections of the path for them to travel.
        </p>

        <p>
        I'd call that progress! Ok, so we haven't solved our problem yet, but
        we've learned a few things.
        </p>

        <p>
        It seems that our next logical step is to see if we can find a way to
        get rid of those dangling Elimination Marks. Perhaps we can
        intentionally introduce mistakes to be eliminated. We'll have to be
        careful about how we do this as they should only really be mistakes
        under certain conditions. We're going to have to think this through.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Intentional Mistakes</h2>

        <p>
        Before we dive into this, let's do a quick recap on how we got here:
        </p>

        <p>
        We're trying to find a reduction from SAT to The Witness. We think
        we can use Suns to represent clauses which are satisfied by pairing each
        up with another Sun of the same colour. In SAT, clauses are satisfied if
        any of their variables evaluate to true. We need to mimic these
        semantics. We almost managed it with Elimination Marks, but ended up
        leaving a surplus in the puzzle. Now we're exploring whether we can fix
        this by introducing intentional mistakes for the Elimination Marks to
        eliminate. Are you still with me?
        </p>

        <p>
        Ok, let's get to business.
        </p>

        <p>
        We need to find a way for there to be a mistake in the same region as
        the Elimination Mark, but only if the Sun is paired. If it is not
        paired, the Elimination Mark should mop up the unpaired Sun, instead.
        Being an unforgiving kind of game, there are actually quite a few ways
        to introduce these kinds of mistakes. Here's one:
        </p>

        <div class="row-of-images">
          <figure class="large-size">
            <img alt="Suns paired: Tetris Block is a mistake" src="images/forced-mistake-1.png" />
            <figcaption>Suns paired: Tetris Block is a mistake</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <figure class="large-size">
            <img alt="Suns not paired: Sun is a mistake" src="images/forced-mistake-2.png" />
            <figcaption>Suns not paired: Sun is a mistake</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

        <p>
        In this case, only the puzzle on the left is correct, but the puzzler
        has the freedom to choose whether to pair the Suns or not. Tetris
        Blocks seem to lend themselves well to this. We can tailor their shape
        to match the region containing the unpaired Sun. This has the effect of
        toggling which thing is eliminated depending on which path is taken.
        Here are some alternatives that would work equally well:
        </p>

        <div class="row-of-images">
          <figure class="medium-size">
            <img alt="Alternative 1" src="images/alternative-1.png" />
            <figcaption>Alternative 1</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <figure class="medium-size">
            <img alt="Alternative 2" src="images/alternative-2.png" />
            <figcaption>Alternative 2</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <figure class="medium-size">
            <img alt="Alternative 3" src="images/alternative-3.png" />
            <figcaption>Alternative 3</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

        <p>
        That last one's a bit different, but ponder it for a moment and you'll
        see that it works. In fact, we could have used some of the other puzzle
        pieces, too. So which of these should we choose?  Let's defer that
        decision for later. Having a few options might help us if we get stuck.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Freedom to Choose</h2>

        <p>
        We can now construct puzzles that contain as many Suns as we'd like and
        the puzzler has the freedom to choose which of those Suns are paired.
        Great! But how does this relate back to our original problem? We were
        trying to build a puzzle for <span class="single-word">(A v B).</span>
        Are we there yet? Well, we haven't defined what it <em>means</em> to
        take one path or another. Does the following path mean A=false, B=true
        or is it just meaningless gibberish?
        </p>

        <div class="row-of-images">
          <figure class="xxlarge-size">
            <img alt="Does this path mean anything?" src="images/elimination-working.png" />
            <figcaption>Does this path <em>mean</em> anything?</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

        <p>
        But hold on a minute – we haven't really defined how a puzzle should be
        constructed for a given SAT problem. We assumed something like the above
        corresponds to <span class="single-word">(A v B),</span> but is that
        really true? We began looking at this from the perspective of 'we have
        too many Suns, how do we cope with that?', but we're yet to tie this
        back to the original problem. What we really need are a few rules for
        how to build these puzzles, but so far we've only considered a single
        example. To proceed, we ought to consider a few more.
        </p>

        <p>
        So let's cast our net a little further and consider
        <span class="single-word">(A) ^ (!A)</span>. I've left the brackets in
        so we can clearly see that this is made up of two clauses. Note that
        this problem is unsatisfiable. Every clause must be true and one of the
        two will be false depending on how we assign A. If you remember back,
        we kind of have a rule that each clause in our equation corresponds to
        a different colour Sun, but how do we deal with negations?
        </p>

        <p>
        Well, we said that 'choice' corresponds to which path is taken through
        the puzzle. If the puzzler chooses a path that represents A=true, they
        should no longer be able to pair up Suns in cases where A is negated.
        Here is a simplified example that uses a Hexagon Dot to force the
        puzzler to make a choice.
        </p>

        <div class="row-of-images">
          <figure class="medium-size">
            <img alt="Forcing a decision" src="images/hexagon-dots.png" />
            <figcaption>Forcing a decision</figcaption>

          <figure class="medium-size">

            <figcaption>A=false, blue Suns paired</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

        <p>
        Earlier on, we talked about using 'forks in the road' to force the
        puzzler to choose how to assign true or false to each variable. That's
        exactly what we're doing here, although it's not as obvious. The fork is
        a decision between North and East from the start position. The Hexagon
        Dot insists that one or the other is chosen, otherwise they could go
        straight up the left-side, which would correspond to assigning both true
        and false to A.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Putting it Together</h2>

        <p>
        So now we're ready to start putting things together. Let's try to do
        this gradually and construct a puzzle that represents
        <span class="single-word">(A v !A).</span> This is a single-clause,
        single-variable problem, but it contains a negation. We know that a
        single clause means we put a Sun in the bottom-right corner. We also
        know that we should add our special combination on the left for each
        occurrence of a variable, so let's do that:
        </p>

        <div class="row-of-images">
          <figure class="xlarge-size">
            <img alt="Putting it together: Part 1" src="images/together-1.png" />
            <figcaption>Putting it together: <span class="single-word">Part 1</span></figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

        <p>
        We then need to force the puzzler to choose whether to assign A=true or
        A=false. We can do this by adding a Hexagon Dot along a path that runs
        between the symbols and an alternate path along the right-hand side. At
        this point, we also need to remove other sections of path:
        </p>

        <div class="row-of-images">
          <figure class="xlarge-size">
            <img alt="Putting it together: Part 2" src="images/together-2.png" />
            <figcaption>Putting it together: <span class="single-word">Part 2</span></figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>


        <p>
        And that's it... or is it? The eagle-eyed amongst you may have noticed a
        problem with this puzzle. We'll get to that in a moment. Before then,
        let's see what paths corresponding to A=true and A=false look like:
        </p>

        <div class="row-of-images">
          <figure class="large-size">
            <img alt="Path for A=true" src="images/together-true.png" />
            <figcaption>Path for A=true</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <figure class="large-size">
            <img alt="Path for A=false" src="images/together-false.png" />
            <figcaption>Path for A=false</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

        <p>
        You can see that the Sun that's paired is different in each case. We've
        arbitrarily defined the bottom Sun to mean A=true and the top to mean
        A=false, but we could flip this if we wanted. The Hexagon Dot we placed
        down the middle forces the puzzler to choose between one or the other.
        </p>

        <p>
        Ok, so what's this problem I mentioned? Well, when we figured out our
        combination of symbols, we hadn't accounted for the case where the
        entire region is skipped. We'd only anticipated a single 1x1 region.
        There are now two mistakes in that region: the Tetris Block and the Sun.
        This is one too many for our Elimination Mark to mop up. We've found a
        bug!
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Fixing the Bug</h2>

        <p>
        Fear not! When we introduced intentional mistakes to the puzzle, we had
        a few alternatives. If we can find one that's valid when contained
        within the skipped region, we're golden. Let's remind ourselves of the
        other ways to introduce intentional mistakes. Which door should we
        choose?
        </p>

        <div class="row-of-images">
          <figure class="medium-size">

        There are goats behind two of these doors. Can you figure out which has
        the sports car?
        </p>

        <p>
        Ok, enough of that. The right answer is Door number 3. This is the only
        pattern where the Tetris Block is valid when the bottom-right Sun is
        paired up. When the region is skipped, the Tetris Block becomes invalid,
        but the Suns within that skipped region are paired, so there is only one
        mistake, rather than two. This is very confusing! Perhaps if we see how
        it works in different contexts, that will help:

        <h2>Some Clarification</h2>

        <p>
        At this point you might be wondering what the difference is between
        'Suns not paired' and 'Suns skipped'. Let's briefly consider the example
        <span class="single-word">(A v A)</span> so that I can clarify:
        </p>

        <div class="row-of-images">
          <figure class="xlarge-size">
            <img alt="The puzzle corresponding to (A v A)" src="images/clarification.png" />
            <figcaption>The puzzle corresponding to <span class="single-word">(A v A)</span></figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

        <p>
        The puzzle above is the same as the
        <span class="single-word">(A v !A)</span> example we looked at earlier
        except we're now using the new pattern of symbols. We've also removed
        the Hexagon Dot running down the middle as we've dropped the negation.
        If we choose the path where A=true, that means we follow the left-hand
        side of the puzzle, up through the symbols. If we choose A=false, that
        leads alongside the symbols, skipping those regions.
        </p>

        <p>
        If we consider the case where A=true, we actually have a choice in which
        Sun is paired. Do we pair one at the top or the bottom? Both are valid.
        This actually corresponds to our equation:
        <span class="single-word">(A v A).</span> If we choose the bottom Sun,
        that's kind of like saying 'use the first A to make the clause true'
        and the top one relates to the second A. Let's see what these cases
        look like, as well as the case for when A=false:
        </p>

        <div class="row-of-images">
          <figure class="medium-size">
            <img alt="A=true, bottom Sun paired" src="images/clarify-first.png" />
            <figcaption>A=true, bottom Sun paired</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <figure class="medium-size">
            <img alt="A=true, top Sun paired" src="images/clarify-second.png" />
            <figcaption>A=true, top Sun paired</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <figure class="medium-size">
            <img alt="A=false, neither paired" src="images/clarify-false.png" />
            <figcaption>A=false, neither paired</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

        <p>
        Notice that the two on the left are both genuine, correct solutions for
        the puzzle, whereas when A=false, the bottom-right Sun has not been
        paired up making it an incorrect solution.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>General Method</h2>

        <p>
        We're now reaching the end of our journey and are ready to formulate our
        general method. When we put everything together, we end up with a
        process that looks something like this:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>1. Place a uniquely coloured Sun bottom-right for each clause</li>
          <li>2. For each variable:
            <ul>
              <li>a. For each clause containing the variable (as a positive):
                <ul>
                  <li>i. Add an Elimination Mark, Tetris Block and Sun to the left of the puzzle</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>b. Add an alternative path that runs alongside this section</li>
              <li>c. Re-combine this path with the main path and add a Hexagonal Dot</li>
              <li>d. Repeat a, b for the case where the variable is negated</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>3. Make the rest of the puzzle unreachable by removing sections of path</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        If this sounds complicated, that's because it is! There's a lot going
        on there, so maybe a concrete example will help. Let's end where we
        started and build the puzzle corresponding to
        <span class="single-word">(A v !B) ^ (!B v !C).</span> I have tried to
        annotate this puzzle as best I can, but it's still incredibly large and
        takes a long time to grok:
        </p>

        <div class="row-of-images">
          <figure class="xxxlarge-size">
            <img alt="The SAT problem (A v !B) ^ (!B v !C) represented as a puzzle from The Witness" src="images/final-puzzle.png" />
            <figcaption>The SAT problem <span class="single-word">(A v !B) ^ (!B v !C)</span> represented as a puzzle from The Witness</figcaption>
          </figure>
        </div>

        <p>
        The puzzle above is the result of reducing our SAT problem to The
        Witness. The method outlined above is the 'reduction' we've been
        seeking. It's quite amazing how we started with a few simple
        observations and by careful reasoning we've ended up with something
        incredibly complex. It's startling just how large the puzzle is for
        such a simple problem. That tends to be how reductions go.
        </p>

        <p>
        Towards the start of this article, when talking about difficult, I said:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          This does assume our reduction isn't too difficult to compute,
          otherwise we'd have to factor that in, too.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
        Let's consider this for a moment. We could write a program that performs
        this reduction. How 'expensive' would it be to compute? Well, although
        we end up with a huge problem, building the puzzle isn't all that
        difficult. Each occurrence of a variable adds roughly 18 cells to the
        grid and that doesn't change whether we have three variables or a
        million. That means we could build this puzzle in linear time by reading
        through the equation.
        </p>

        <p>
        Finally, here are a couple of correct paths through the puzzle:
        </p>

        <h2>Closing Words</h2>

        <p>
        Hopefully this has given you some intuition for how reductions work.
        This is arguably a lot more complicated than most, but perhaps more
        interesting, too. One of the wonderful implications of all this is that
        you could solve all kinds of problems like route planning by reducing
        them to fiendishly difficult Witness puzzles. Those puzzles would
        probably be so large they'd reach the moon!
        </p>

        <p>
        If this article has piqued your interest, you may wish to try writing a
        program to do this reduction. I'll happily add links to code or
        screenshots to this section if anyone is determined enough to try it. If
        the reduction in the other direction seems tempting, that's something
        I'd like to look at in coming months. I don't think it's possible for
        reasons I won't go into here.
        </p>

        <p>
        You may be interested to hear that I'm writing a programming language
        called 'Sentient' that deals with these kinds of problems. It's still in
        alpha, but you can find the website
        <a href="http://sentient-lang.org/">here</a>.
        Finally, I'd like to thank
        <a href="https://twitter.com/tomstuart">Tom Stuart</a>
        for encouraging me to put pen to paper. I'd also like to thank
