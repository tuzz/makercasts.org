    MakerCasts is a screencast series about making <strong>imaginative
    things with code</strong>. Episodes explore topics from computer science
    and mathematics, from the perspective of a web developer.

    I believe the best way to really understand something is to <strong>put
    theory into practice</strong>. In each series, we'll do just that by
    creating toy projects <span class="nowrap">to play</span> with, gaining
    insight of the core ideas.
