      What is MakerCasts?
    </h2>

    <p class="overview__paragraph">
    MakerCasts is a screencast series about <strong>making imaginative
    things with code</strong>. Episodes explore topics from computer science
    and mathematics from the perspective of a web developer.
    </p>

    <p class="overview__paragraph">
    I believe the best way to really understand something is to <strong>put
    theory into practice</strong>. In each series, we'll do just that by
    creating toy projects to play with, building intuition of the core
    ideas.
